\subsection{Encoders}
\label{sec:implementation_encoding}

While the encoding described in this paper, and thus implemented in OpenECC, is probabilistic (meaning that no
guarantee can be made to its success) other algorithms for encoding do exist.

\textbf{Note: Something about injective encoding/mapping a point}

\textbf{Note: With such points it is nice to be able to swap it out to do other encodings for other kinds of points}
