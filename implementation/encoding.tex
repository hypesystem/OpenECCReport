\subsection{Encoders}
\label{sec:implementation_encoding}

While the encoding described in this paper, and thus implemented in OpenECC, is probabilistic (meaning that no
guarantee can be made to its success) other algorithms for encoding do exist. While being significantly more
mathematically advanced, they provide both performance and probability improvements.\cite{MappingAMessage}
Being open for the future addition of these different encoders, and others that may be discovered, is important
for the possible performance of the project.
