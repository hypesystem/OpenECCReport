Note: Write about the Encryption.Core lib (basic constructs, why are there so many similar classes that are held
as different objects? because this is good object oriented design. passing around non-descript byte[] is BAD design).

Note: The encryption is structured in such a way that it is trivial to add different encryptors to the project.

Note: Write about the interface IEncryptor and show a class diagram of ElGamalEncryptor as an example.
