\subsubsection{Finite Fields}

An integral part of Elliptic Curve (and much other) cryptography is finite fields and arithmetic
over finite fields. Per default no such functionality exists in C\#.

BouncyCastle contains, among other things, an implementation of finite fields. In order to quickly
build the na√Øve version of OpenECC, this was used in the first version.

Integrating *just* the Org.BouncyCastle.Math.EC.FpFieldElement (finite field implementation) into
the project is not trivial, however, as it uses a BigInteger implementation defined in BouncyCastle,
which differs from that in C\#'s System.Numerics.BigInteger.

To solve these issues, a wrapper (FiniteFieldElement) was created. This wrapper maps from BouncyCastle's
BigIntegers to the normal BigIntegers, reducing the boilerplate between BouncyCastle and OpenECC to
just one class.

The primary problem here is converting between the two BigInteger implementations\footnote{This seems
to be a previously unsolved problem, which has previously been posed (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21756578/how-do-i-round-trip-a-number-to-bouncycastle-biginteger-system-numerics-big)}.
This is done by ...?
