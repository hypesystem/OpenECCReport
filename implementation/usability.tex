\subsection{Usability}

Note: Compare syntax with that of BouncyCastle for different operations: addition, multiplication, example of encryption
(show mapping from mathematical formula to code).

Note: Talk about interfaces of the classes, and show how easy it is to encrypt something (code from test?) compared to
BouncyCastle.
