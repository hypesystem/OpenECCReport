\subsection{Choosing a Curve}

Weierstrass simple form is very easy to perform operations on. This is also the one
BouncyCastle primarily supports (\verb|FpCurve|). Weierstrass curves are of the form
\(y^2 = x^3 + ax + b\). Arithmetic operations on points in a curve of the Weierstrass
simple form are fairly easy to implement.
