Elliptic curves can be used as the foundation of cryptosystems. Elliptic Curve Cryptography is constructed
from several layers: curves and points, scalar multiplication algorithms, encoding and decoding algorithms,
and encryption and decryption algorithms.

The mathematical foundations and algorithms for some possible implementations of each layer (including NAF
and wNAF multiplication algorithms and elliptic curve ElGamal encryption) are investigated and reported.

Each possibility is implemented in a C\# (.NET) library, \emph{OpenECC}, and the structure and design decisions
for this library are discussed. OpenECC provides a modular architecture and a natural syntax.

The performance of the implementation is measured and discussed, and is found to be similar to that of existing
ECC implementations.
