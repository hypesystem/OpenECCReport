\section{OpenECC Disclaimer}
\label{app:disclaimer}

Disclaimer: OpenECC should not be used in real-world applications. It exists, in its current form, as
an instructive example, nothing more.

Security against timing attacks is not within the scope of what is produced here. The implementation
does not claim to be safe, in any other sense than that it computes the correct math, and produces
the correct encryptions and decryptions. It should not be used in real software.

Note: Hankerson 219-?? regards Timings.

Note: Consider writing more about implementation issues. Hankerson 205-?
