\section{Testing against the Bouncy Castle implementation}

Early in the implementation effort, it was important to verify the correctness of the work done. Seeing
as the naive implementation concerned itself only with features that had already been implemented in
the BouncyCastle\footnote{https://www.bouncycastle.org/} project, which is widely used, testing against
this implementation seemed natural.

In addition to a verification of the functionality this provided us with an easy comparison of the syntax
used in BouncyCastle versus that of OpenECC.

The tests centered first(?) around the arithmetic operations, testing addition (including adding infinity
and doubling), subtraction, and multiplication.
