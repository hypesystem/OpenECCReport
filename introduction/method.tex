\subsection{Method}

This project will show a C\#.NET-based implementation of Elliptic Curve Cryptography, including a curve, operations on points in the curve, and a key-exchange protocol. Furthermore, the performance of the implementation will be analysed as the algorithms (for example for point-operations) are gradually improved.

The report will recount relevant theory for each iteration, and the analysis will involve comparisons with the performance of existing and used key-exchange protocols.
