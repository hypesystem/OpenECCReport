\subsection{Safe Curves}

The safety of a curve depends on the ECDLP (Hankerson et.al. pp. 153-155). "While hardness of the ECDLP is necessary
for the security of any eliiptic curve cryptographic scheme, it is generally not sufficient." (Hankerson et.al. p 171)
(Note: These should probably be covered peripherally, as well.)

SafeCurves contains proofs for safe curves. (Note: Add quick walk-through of what makes a curve safe, according
to SafeCurves.)
