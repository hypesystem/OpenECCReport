\subsection{Curves and Point Arithmetic}
\label{sec:math_curve}

As point multiplication is the action that takes the most time to perform,\cite{safecurves} several algorithms exist to
speed this up. Some of these will be discussed here (Section \ref{sec:math_curve_multiplication}). While only Weierstrass
curves are discussed in detail, the differences between Weierstrass curves and curves of other forms are touched upon briefly
(Section \ref{sec:math_curve_curves}).

Conceptually, the addition of two points, \(P + Q = R\), is done by drawing a line through the points, \(P\) and \(Q\),
and finding the point \(-R\), where the line intersects the curve again. This point is
then reflected over the x-axis to find \(R\), the result.

There are a few cases that are not explained by this conceptual model: if a point is added to its reflection, \(P + (-P)\),
the line drawn through the two points will not intersect the curve at any other point. The result of such an addition is
the point at infinity, \(O_\infty\). An addition where one point is the point at infinity will be the point that is not
infinity: \(P + O_\infty = P\).

The double of \(P\), \(2P\) or \(P+P\), is found by drawing the tangent of the curve at \(P\).
\(-R\) is once again found at the line's (in this case the tangent's) next intersection
with the curve, and the result \(R\), is found by reflecting \(-R\).\cite{hankerson2010}
