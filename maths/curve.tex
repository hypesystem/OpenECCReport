\subsection{Curves and Point Arithmetic}

Note: Add illustration of the arithmetic, and introduction here that explains that we are about to read
the theoretical workings of the arithmetic (before delving into how these are calculated in different
sources).

The addition of two points, \(P + Q = R\), is done by drawing a line through the points, \(P\) and \(Q\),
and finding the point \(R_{reflection})\), where the line intersects the curve again. This point is
then reflected over the x-axis to find \(R\), the result. (Guide to Elliptic Curve Crypto... p. 79)

The double of \(P\), \(2P\) or \(P+P\), is found by drawing the tangent of the curve at \(P\).
\(R_{reflection}\) is once again found at the line's (in this case the tangent's) next intersection
with the curve, and the result \(R\), is found by reflecting \(R_{reflection}\). (Guide to Elliptic Curve Crypto... p.79)

Note: Negation of points, subtraction.

A point can be multiplied with an integer \(dP\), which is the equivalent of adding \(P\) to itself \(d\) times.

Note: Why did we choose weierstrass instead of F2m curves (possibly supersingular)?

Note: Make sure the curves are comparable from the description, or compare them when presenting
the montgomery curves.
