\subsection{Encryption}
\label{sec:math_encryption}

Public key encryption is often used to distribute keys for symmetric encryption schemes, as asymmetric encryption
is generally slower than symmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption cannot be used for the first contact between
two parties, and as such public key encryption is the first step of communicating secret data.
