Curves of this \emph{simple Weierstrass form} allow for simple point arithmetic: the
calculations are simpler, compared to other forms of curves used. The Weierstrass simple forms are
the only forms of curves supported by Bouncy Castle\footnote{Bouncy Castle, at the time of writing,
supports \emph{FpCurve} over a prime field \(\mathbb{F}_p\) with any prime \(p\), and \emph{F2mCurve}
-- in both non-supersingular and supersingular forms -- over fields \(\mathbb{F_{2^m}}\) with any \(m\).
The latter of these have the forms \(y^2 + xy = x^3 + ax^2 + b\) and
\(y^2 + cy = x^3 + ax + b\), and neither are supported in \emph{OpenECC} nor explained in any kind
of detail in this paper. All three of these forms are Weierstrass simple forms.}.
