An elliptic curve \(E\) defined over a prime field \(\mathbb{F}_p\) can be reduced to the following form,
called the \emph{simple Weierstrass form}:

\begin{equation}
	E: y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
\end{equation}

The discriminant \(\Delta = 4a^3 + 27b^2 \neq 0\) ensures that each point in the curve has its own
unique tangent line. Such curves allow for simple point arithmetic: the
calculations are simpler (though not necessarily more efficient) than other forms of curves (see Section \ref{sec:math_curve_curves}). The Weierstrass forms are
the only forms of curves supported by Bouncy Castle.\footnote{Bouncy Castle, at the time of writing,
supports \emph{FpCurve} over a prime field \(\mathbb{F}_p\) with any prime \(p\), and \emph{F2mCurve}
-- in both non-supersingular (\(a_1 \neq 0\)) and supersingular (\(a_1 = 0\)) forms (cf. Equation
\ref{eq:elliptic-curve-formula-full}) -- over fields \(\mathbb{F}_{2^m}\) with any \(m\).
The latter of these have the forms \(y^2 + xy = x^3 + ax^2 + b\) and
\(y^2 + cy = x^3 + ax + b\), and neither are supported in \emph{OpenECC} nor explained in any kind
of detail in this report. All three of these forms are Weierstrass simple forms.\cite{bouncycastle}}

On a curve of this form arithmetic consists of a few, very approachable calculations.
