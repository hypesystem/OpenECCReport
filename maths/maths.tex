There are several distinct mathematical constructs required for building a working cryptosystem using elliptic
curves, ranging from the basic concepts of points and curves to the more abstract concepts of encodings and
encryptions. Elliptic curve arithmetic is a subset of finite field arithmetic, but as the latter is outside
of the scope of this project, an external source was used (see Section \ref{sec:implementation__dependencies}) and
the mathematics underlying finite fields will not be discussed here.

In the following, the mathematical constructs required for encryption are shown: arithmetic with points on the simplest
form of curves (the Weierstrass simple form, Section \ref{sec:math_curve}), probabilistic encoding of a string message
to a point on a given curve (Section \ref{sec:math_encoding}), and encryption of a point on a curve (using a version
of the ElGamal public key encryption scheme that has been adapted to elliptic curves, Section \ref{sec:math_encryption}).
