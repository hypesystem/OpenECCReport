\section{Mathematical Foundation}

There are several distinct mathematical constructs required for building a working encryption scheme using Elliptic
Curve Cryptography. Elliptic curve arithmetic is a subset of finite field arithmetic, but as the latter is outside
of the scope of this project, an external source was used (see Section \ref{sec:implementation__dependencies}) and
the mathematics underlying finite fields will not be discussed here.

Conceptually, the addition of two points, \(P + Q = R\), is done by drawing a line through the points, \(P\) and \(Q\),
and finding the point \(-R)\), where the line intersects the curve again. This point is
then reflected over the x-axis to find \(R\), the result.

The double of \(P\), \(2P\) or \(P+P\), is found by drawing the tangent of the curve at \(P\).
\(-R\) is once again found at the line's (in this case the tangent's) next intersection
with the curve, and the result \(R\), is found by reflecting \(-R\).\cite{hankerson2010}

In the following, the mathematical constructs required for encryption are shown: artihmetic with points on the simplest
form of curves (the Weierstrass simple form, Section \ref{sec:math_curve}), probablistic encoding of a string message
to a point on a given curve (Section \ref{sec:math_encoding}), and encryption of a point on a curve (using a version
of the ElGamal public key encryption scheme that has been adapted to elliptic curves, Section \ref{sec:math_encryption}).
