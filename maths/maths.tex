\section{Mathematical Foundation}

There are several distinct mathematical constructs required for building a working encryption scheme using Elliptic
Curve Cryptography. Elliptic curve arithmetic is a subset of finite field arithmetic, but as the latter is outside
of the scope of this project, an external source was used (see Section \ref{sec:implementation__dependencies}) and
the mathematics underlying finite fields will not be discussed here.

\textbf{Note: Add illustration of the arithmetic, and introduction here that explains that we are about to read
the theoretical workings of the arithmetic (before delving into how these are calculated in different
sources).}

Conceptually, the addition of two points, \(P + Q = R\), is done by drawing a line through the points, \(P\) and \(Q\),
and finding the point \(-R)\), where the line intersects the curve again. This point is
then reflected over the x-axis to find \(R\), the result.

The double of \(P\), \(2P\) or \(P+P\), is found by drawing the tangent of the curve at \(P\).
\(R_{reflection}\) is once again found at the line's (in this case the tangent's) next intersection
with the curve, and the result \(R\), is found by reflecting \(-R\).\cite{hankerson2010}

In the following, the mathematical constructs required for encryption are shown: artihmetic with points on the simplest
form of curves (the Weierstrass simple form, Section \ref{sec:math_curve}), probablistic encoding of a string message
to a point on a given curve (Section \ref{sec:math_encoding}), and encryption of a point on a curve (using a version
of the ElGamal public key encryption scheme that has been adapted to elliptic curves, Section \ref{sec:math_encryption}).
