\subsection{Encoding}

In order to represent messages as points (as used in ElGamal encryption, see \ref{sec:math_enc_elgamal}) they must be encoded.

InjectiveEncodings:

\begin{quote}
    For certain groups \(\mathbb{G}\), like ... supersingular elliptic curves, it is not difficult to construct injective
	encodings...
\end{quote}

(from p.2) Supersingular curves are \(F_2m\) curves (not supported by us).

2.4: One can construct a probablistic injective encoding with size equal to about half of the size of \(\mathbb{G}\) (p.2)
