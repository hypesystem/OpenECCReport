\subsection{Montgomery Curves}

Most safe curves\foonote{According to http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/} are not of the naively suppoorted
Weierstrass simple form, but rather of the slightly different \emph{Montgomery form}. Montgomery curves
have the form \(y^2 = x^3 + ax^2 + x\).

Montgomery curves can be translated into the Weierstrass simple form (although the reverse is not always
possible)\footnote{http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/equation.html}, but with the cost that the Weierstrass form
will have parameters that are huge compared to the Montgomery form. For example, the Montgomery curve,
\verb|Curve25519| has the equation \(y^2 = x^3+486662x^2+x\)\footnote{http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/}, but
translated into the Weierstrass simple form, it will have an equation that does not fit on a normal A4

\(y^2 = x^3 + 19298681539552699237261830834781317975544997444273427339909597334573241639236x + 55751746669818908907645289078257140818241103727901012315294400837956729358436\)

Note: What is "acceptable change in parameters"? (Guide to Elliptic Curve Cryptography)

Operations on this curve are much harder.

In addition to smaller parameters, Montgomery curves have other inherent factors that result in quicker
computations\footnote{source?}.

These are two strong arguments (safety and performance) for supporting Montgomery curves natively (and
not just through transformations). The question then becomes: is it feasible in the scope of this
project to implement these curves?

To be elaborated...
