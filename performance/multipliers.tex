\subsection{Multiplier Comparison}

With the different multiplication algorithms, there is an underlying assumption regarding their performance. The more
advanced algorithms use fewer additions, which should - in theory - be quicker. However, there might be other things
to take into account, such as pre-computations and other overhead.



To determine which algorithm is actually the fastest for use in OpenECC, all of them are tested. The test performs a
full  encryption of the string \verb+"Hello, World."+ (involving all layers of the software). A hundred tests are run
per algorithm, and the average time spent is recorded.

Most of the algorithms do not have modifiable parameters, but the wNAF algorithm has a variable window size \(w\). For
this reason, the wNAF algorithm has been tested with a variety of window sizes, to determine which is the best.

The Double-and-Add algorithm has been implemented in both a recursive fashion (where it repeatedly calls itself, causing
overhead), and a binary-based version (where there is a slight overhead involved with finding the binary representation
of the number).

		having run each algorithm 100 times. Using \(wNAF_3\), full encryption of the string \texttt{"Hello, World."}
		takes an average of \(491 \text{ ms}\).}
