\section{Performance}
\label{sec:performance}
 
Several algorithms for scalar point multiplication were implemented. To determine which of these is the most efficient,
and should used per default, they must be compared.
 
The performance of OpenECC, in its whole, can be judged by an analysis of each of the
individual underlying components. This analysis will help to figure out where performance bottlenecks (if
any) exist, and what constructs (curves, multipliers, encoders or encryptors) should be improved.
 
Bouncy Castle is an existing implementation of (among others) the features offered by OpenECC. Comparing the performance
between the two gives an idea of the real-world applicability of the algorithms and implementations described.
