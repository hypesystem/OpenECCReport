\section{Performance}
\label{sec:performance}

Note: Measure every different combination of the constructs created (see maths section). Create beautiful graphs!

\subsection{BouncyCastle Comparison}
\label{sec:performance_bouncycastle}
Note: Measure against bouncycastle encryption with the same curve. Create beautiful (but devastating) graph!

Note: Measure against a different (non-ECC) library for encryption (but which?). Add this to the devastating graph.
