\section{Performance}
\label{sec:performance}

 --- introduction ---
 
 \textbf{Note: Answer the introduction's claims? Talk about why performance is measured, what the goal is with measuring the
 performance.}
 
 \textbf{Note: Mention the total running time of encryption 491 ms (with computer specs Intel Core i3)}
 
 In order to judge the performance of OpenECC, and with it the mathematical constructs used, an analysis of each of the
 individual underlying components is fitting: This analysis will help to figure out where performance bottlenecks (if
 any) exist, and what constructs (curves, multipliers, encoders or encryptors) should be improved.
