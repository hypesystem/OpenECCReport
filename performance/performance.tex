\section{Performance}
\label{sec:performance}

 \textbf{Note: Answer the introduction's claims? Talk about why performance is measured, what the goal is with measuring the
 performance.}
 
 Several algorithms for scalar point multiplication were implemented. To determine which of these is the most efficient,
 and should used per default, they must be compared.
 
 The performance of OpenECC, in its whole, can be judged by an analysis of each of the
 individual underlying components. This analysis will help to figure out where performance bottlenecks (if
 any) exist, and what constructs (curves, multipliers, encoders or encryptors) should be improved.
