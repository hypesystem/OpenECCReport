\section{Performance}
\label{sec:performance}

Note: Measure every different combination of the constructs created (see maths section). Create beautiful graphs!

Note: Where in the program is time spent? How much time does each thing take? (BigInteger conversion is probably
a time-stealer!!!)

Write a timemanager class and Timed* Wrappers of everything, so the constructs can be measured:

\begin{verbatim}
class TimedEncryptor {
  public TimedEncryptor(IEncryptor end) {...}
  public Ciphertext Encrypt(...) {
    StartTimer
    var result = enc.Encrypt(...);
    RecordTime
    return result;
  }
}
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{BouncyCastle Comparison}
\label{sec:performance_bouncycastle}
Note: Measure against bouncycastle encryption with the same curve. Create beautiful (but devastating) graph!

Note: Measure against a different (non-ECC) library for encryption (but which?). Add this to the devastating graph.
